# Safer Care Co-Op

## Description

Check it out HERE

Safer Care Co-Op is a space for people who face discrimination from healthcare practitioners due to the marginalized and oppressed identities they hold to find safer doctors and therapists. Originally this project was started with only transgender people in mind, but it quickly broadened in scope to include other identities. In order to be more accessible, Safer Care Co-Op does not require an account. Right now it is only for the Minneapolis area. If even one person finds a healthcare practitioner that they can trust, then this project has been a success.
